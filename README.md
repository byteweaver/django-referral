# django-referral

A small django application for marketing using referral links

## What is this app good for?

Imagine you got a nice website running and you want to make some marketing in order to gain more users.
This can be achieved by spreading links/banners over the internet pointing to your website.
Now in order to find out how your banners performed you need to know how many users registered
after clicking on one of your banners. To tell them apart you add some unique GET parameter to
each link. This app will detect those referral parameters and store for each user what referrer
lead him to your website.

## Key Features

* Manual and automatic referrer generation.
* Referrer organisation in campaigns.
* Automatic associating of referrers with campaigns using patterns.
* Referrers will be cached in sessions, so when a user first browses your site and does not
  immediately register the referrer will be cached and assigned when the user finally decides
  to register. That way you can link to any site and not necessarily a register page.
* Very easy integration.
* Completely configurable to your needs.
* Django-south support
* No dependencies
* 100% Test coverage

## Integration
